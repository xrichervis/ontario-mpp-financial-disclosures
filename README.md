# Scraping Ontario MPP's Public Disclosures Statements

This web crawler was built to scrape the Office of the Integrity Commissioner's <a href="https://www.app.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/cst/searchSchool.asp">Ontario MPP Public Disclosure Statements dynamic database<a>. The crawler is built using the Python package Selenium, operates independently via Chromedriver, and automatically parses what data is available to readers. 
  
More detailed read.me file and data dictionnary to come.
